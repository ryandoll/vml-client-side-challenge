VML Client-Side Challenge
=========================

VML will be hosting it's 1st Client-Side Challenge on July 30th at 12PM at the 2020 office in the Northern Star. We might expand this to other offices outside of Kansas City, but for our first one, we will keep it focused on Kansas City to work out any kinks.  This will be an extracurricular competition that you can partake in during your lunch hour, and VML will be providing pizza.  The basics of the competition:

- Any VMLer or VML contractor can participate. 
- You will be provided with a task with certain limitations/criteria that must be met. 
- The task itself will not be revealed until the start of the competition.
- Task should take roughly 30 to 45 minutes to complete.
- Fork this repo, and look for the specific task instructions in that month's folder.
- You will be provided a very slim project shell, that will include all expected file types to be submitted back (or none if the task calls for it). All you have to do is modify them!
- Once the task is complete, submit a pull request back to the original GitHub repo with your solution.
- 1st dev to submit a working solution given the task requirements wins!
- There will be a prize for 1st place, as well as a trophy! 
- Some challenges might be CSS only, or JavaScript only, or both! SCARY!  

You will need to RSVP by emailing [Ryan Doll](mailto:rdoll@vml.com) before the day of the event, so we can have a proper headcount for pizza.  If you have any questions, just email Ryan.

Good luck to all those competing!
